# Forex-Fusion

This is a very vast and open ended project that is going to continue for a long time. As and when I get new ideas and plans, I am going to implement them.

A broad idea is to create a well balanced multi-asset portfolio which generates significant alpha. Risk minimisation is another aspect that is going to be facotred in. Many measures and stress tests are going to be taken care of before this comes to a final form. Ultimately, a robust portfolio allocation program/system will be the final product/result of this project.

Biggest concern of any investor is that how much capital should be allocated to which assets. Basically how should they be able to diversify their protfolio wo that it performs eternally. This project will be addressing that issue.

This tells us that 3 individual strategies portfolios (Standard Deviation, ROC , PSAR) are outperforming the multi-strategy portfolio based on HURST EXPONENT on the basis of SHARPE(fitness in layman terms).

While 2 strategies portfolios (ROC , PSAR) are outperforming the multi-strategy portfolio based on HURST EXPONENT on the basis of RETURN
